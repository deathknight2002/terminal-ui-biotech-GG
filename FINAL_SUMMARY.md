### Before This PR
- **5 diseases** (DMD, nSCLC, T2D, COVID-19, SCD)
- Static selection buttons
- Single data source (internal mock data)
- No search capability
- Limited disease information

### After This PR
- **17+ diseases** across 9 categories
- Real-time search with filters
- **3 authoritative data sources** (SEER + WHO + CDC)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Comprehensive disease information with source attribution

---
