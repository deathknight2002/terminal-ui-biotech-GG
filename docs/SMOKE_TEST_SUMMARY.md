- ✅ Root dependencies installed
- ✅ Workspace dependencies (mobile, terminal, components, backend)
- ✅ Mobile platform files
- ✅ Desktop platform files
- ✅ Component library build status
- ✅ Port availability (3000, 3001, 3002)

**Output:**
```bash
========================================
Pre-flight Check Summary
========================================

Results:
  ✓ Passed: 23
  ✗ Failed: 2
  ⚠ Warnings: 1

✓ Pre-flight check PASSED
Your development environment is ready!
```

**When to use:**
- Before starting development each day
- After pulling new code

6. **Keep tests updated** - Add new features to checklists

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Tests failing consistently?
1. Run `npm install` again
2. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
3. Reinstall: `npm install`
4. Build components: `npm run build:components`

### Mobile verification stuck?
- Check port 3002 is free
- Verify firewall isn't blocking
- Try different browser
- Check console for errors

### Dev servers won't start?
1. Kill processes on ports: `lsof -i :3000,3001,3002`
2. Check for syntax errors: `npm run typecheck`
3. Ensure components built: `npm run build:components`

### Interactive test not loading?
- Open in modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try different browser
- Ensure file isn't blocked by security
