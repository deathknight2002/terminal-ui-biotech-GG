- Limitations and caveats are disclosed
- Update frequencies are published

### 2. Quality
- Data validation at ingestion
- Completeness scoring for all records
- Reliability indicators by source
- Regular data quality audits

### 3. Traceability
- Complete audit trail for all data
- Version control and change tracking
- Source provenance documentation
- Data lineage mapping

### 4. Compliance
- Adherence to data use agreements
- Respect for licensing terms
- Privacy protection (no PII)
- Ethical use of public health data

## Data Quality Framework

### Quality Indicators

Each disease record includes:

1. **Completeness Score (0-1)**
   - Calculated as: (filled fields / total fields)
   - Displayed as percentage in UI
   - Minimum threshold: 0.6 (60%)

2. **Reliability Score (0-1)**
   - Based on data source authority
   - SEER/WHO/CDC: 0.9-1.0 (High)
   - Derived/Calculated: 0.7-0.8 (Medium)
   - User-submitted: 0.4-0.6 (Low)

3. **Source Count**
   - Number of authoritative sources
   - Multiple sources increase confidence
   - Displayed in audit endpoint

4. **Data Freshness**
   - Time since last update
   - Visual indicators: Fresh (<7 days), Recent (<30 days), Stale (>90 days)
   - Automatic alerts for stale data

### Validation Rules

**At Ingestion:**
- Required fields must be present
- Numeric ranges checked (e.g., rates 0-100,000)
- ICD codes validated against standard
- Geographic codes validated (ISO 3166)
- Temporal consistency checked

**Ongoing:**
- Periodic data quality audits
- Anomaly detection for outliers
- Cross-source consistency checks
- Historical trend validation

## Data Provenance & Lineage

### Tracking Requirements

Every data record maintains:

```typescript
{
  disease_id: "lung_cancer_001",
  last_sync: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  source_hash: "a1b2c3d4...",  // SHA-256 of source data
  data_sources: ["SEER", "CDC"],
  
  source_metadata: {
    seer: {
      collection_date: "2023-04-01",
      data_version: "2023-Q1",
      source_url: "https://seer.cancer.gov/...",
      reliability_indicator: "High"
    },
    cdc: {
      collection_date: "2023-08-15",
      data_version: "2023",
      source_url: "https://data.cdc.gov/...",
      reliability_indicator: "High"
    }
  }
}
```

### Change History

Ingestion logs track:
- Pipeline execution times
- Records processed/inserted/updated/failed
- Error messages and details
- Source hash changes
- Execution metadata

Query: `SELECT * FROM data_ingestion_logs WHERE data_source = 'SEER' ORDER BY start_time DESC;`
